        <h3> Our Story </h3>
        <p> <strong>Three scoops of ice cream. Whipped cream. Nuts. A river of rich, bittersweet hot fudge. </strong>
          To many, that's heaven in a  white clamshell dish. A venerable Chicago institution known far and wide, Margie's Candies has delighted young and old with our homemade sundaes, shakes, and hand-dipped candies for more than 90 years.
          Our love story with everything sweet and decadent began in 1921, when Peter George Poulos opened an ice cream parlor on the North Side of Chicago. In 1933, the shop became known as Margie's Candies when Poulos' son George Peter Poulos married his sweetheart, Margie Michaels.
          Their son Peter George, our current owner, was born in 1936 and grew up in the store â€” literally. His father created a cradle in back of the candy case to hold baby Peter George.
          Peter George learned the fine art of candy making from his grandfather and started working at the shop "when I was old enough to be seen." He has  been here for more than 60 years.
          His son George, now in his 20's, "a great fudge  maker," is the fourth generation to learn the intricacies of the  business, and the plan is for young George to take over the helm someday.
